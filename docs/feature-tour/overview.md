# Overview
Kint is an interactive debugger for PHP applications. Full documentation is available at https://github.com/kint-php/kint/.

Its advantages include that it can be run out of devMode (though you would not want to use it in a public setting), and
it is interactive, with keyboard shortcuts to expand and collapse objects, separates content from methods, etc.

## Using Kint
